Many of our Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), Federal Agencies, and Third Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs) share common issues and questions when going through the FedRAMP process. To help guide our stakeholders, we provide weekly tips and address frequently asked questions and concerns. Below you will find our most recent month of Tips & Cues. To receive our weekly email, sign up [here](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USGSA/subscriber/new?qsp=USGSA_2224) for our listserv. 

You can also review and search all of our past Tips & Cues by downloading our compilation document <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/resources/documents/FedRAMP_Tips_and_Cues.pdf">here</a>.

<h2>July 2018 Tips & Cues</h2>

<div class="q3">
<h3>Q: For my JAB P-ATO package, who should I list as the FedRAMP POC in my SSP and other package documents?</h3>
<p>
A: For the SSP main document (excluding operational documents) the FedRAMP POC should be info@fedramp.gov. For procedural docs that include interaction around security procedures (IR and CP), the primary JAB Reviewer/POC should be listed.
For agency ATO packages, work with your agency to determine the appropriate POCs.

<h3>Q: I’m no longer required to include vulnerabilities on my POA&M that are not “late” according to FedRAMP requirements. Can I still report on-schedule scan items in my POA&M?</h3>
<p>
A: Yes. Excluding non-late scan items is optional and will not impact FedRAMP’s processing.

<h3>TIP: The rationale for Risk Adjustment (RA) and Operational Requirement (OR) provided in <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/templates/FedRAMP-Vulnerability-Deviation-Request-Form.pdf">deviation requests</a>  should be based exclusively on risk (e.g., description of the likelihood and/or impact if the vulnerability was exploited and why), not availability or priority of resources.</h3>
<p>
For the purposes of the RA and OR deviation requests, discussion should be based on security risk. Make every effort to detail original risk score and adjusted risk score with clear description of the mitigations that contribute to the downgrade such that the remaining risk is understood.

<h3>TIP: In Table 4-1 of the SAR, please ensure that the columns, “Risk Statement” and “Mitigating Controls/Factors” contain the following information:</h3>
<p>
Risk Statement: Provide a risk statement that describes the risk to the business. Indicate whether the affected host(s) is/are internally or externally facing.
 </p>
<p>
Mitigating Controls/Factors: Describe any applicable mitigating controls/factors that could downgrade the likelihood or risk exposure. Also indicate whether the affected host(s) is/are internally or externally facing. Include a full description of any mitigating factors and/or compensating controls if the risk is an operational requirement.

<div class="q3">
<h3>TIP: Due to “chain of custody” control, the JAB Technical Reviewers cannot move Continuous Monitoring (ConMon) documents if the CSP or 3PAO uploaded them to incorrect folders in OMB MAX.</h3>
<p>
Please ensure that you upload ConMon documents to their correct respective folders!

<h3>TIP: To access the document that lists all of the cryptographic modules that have been submitted for evaluation and are currently in process, please visit: http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/inprocess.html</h3>
<p>
The title of the document is  <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Module-Validation-Program/Modules-In-Process/Modules-In-Process-List">"Cryptographic Module Validation Program FIPS 140-2 Modules In Process List"</a>
</p>
<p>
On this page, anyone can determine the status of any cryptographic modules that have been submitted to NIST for evaluation. The categories available are:
 </p>
 <p>
- Review Pending
 </p>
 <p>
- In Review
 </p>
 <p>
- Coordination (this process may be iterative)
 </p>
 <p>
- Finalization
 </p>
 <p>
Once you are on this page, please see the right hand side of the page for a url for  <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Cryptographic-Module-Validation-Program/Validated-Modules">”Validated Modules."</a> Clicking this link reveals another page where there is another link, <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/validated-modules/search">”SEARCH our database of validated modules.”</a>
 </p>
 <p>
 <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/cryptographic-module-validation-program/validated-modules/search">Here</a> anyone can search for the product validation and the modules via the certificate number, the name of the vendor, or the name of the module, or all three if these are available.

<h3>TIP: Be mindful of references to several assorted documents within the System Security Plan (SSP).</h3>
<p>
It's important that referenced information should be accessible for the customers that would like to review the packages ahead of time.
