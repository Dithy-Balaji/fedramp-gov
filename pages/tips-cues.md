Many of our Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), Federal Agencies, and Third Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs) share common issues and questions when going through the FedRAMP process. To help guide our stakeholders, we provide weekly tips and address frequently asked questions and concerns. Below you will find our most recent month of Tips & Cues. To receive our weekly email, sign up [here](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USGSA/subscriber/new?qsp=USGSA_2224) for our listserv.

<h2>March 2018 Tips & Cues</h2>
<div class="q1">
<h3>TIP: Avoid adding time to your authorization process by successfully completing the System Security Plan (SSP) review the first time! Here are some tips from the FedRAMP PMO on how to create a strong SSP.</h3>

<p>

1. Submit a complete and well structured SSP.

2. Dedicate enough resources – often one writer is not enough to complete the SSP, and you may have to allot additional resources and subject matter experts to complete.
 
3. Employ the four C’s of writing: Clear – straightforward, avoiding convoluted or overly long phrases; Concise – pack the most meaning into your words; Concrete – concrete writing is precise and detail oriented; and Correct – correct grammar, mechanics, and format are baseline expectations for writing.
 
4. Ensure the writer(s) has knowledge of the system and/or can obtain the information from others and be able to communicate it.
 
5. Perform a quality review on the SSP.
 
Doing these things cannot guarantee a successful SSP review, but will greatly enhance your chances. <em>(March 28, 2018) </em>

<h3>Q: What is a security architecture diagram and what should it include?</h3>

<p><strong>A:</strong> A security architecture diagram is a component of the System Security Plan (SSP) that illustrates how technical security controls are implemented in the environment. It also articulates the overall security program strategy in alignment with the position and selection of security control implementations. A security architecture diagram MUST be a stand-alone document and address the requirements outlined in the control supplemental guidance in PL-8. It is not sufficient to reference other sections of the SSP or outside product guides.
 
Architectural and network diagrams must include all possible communication links between the CSP and Federal Agencies, as well as paths into the system boundary. If customers are not yet connecting directly, a CSP can identify all planned connection points in the SSP. The diagrams should be completed prior to writing implementation statements. <em>(March 28, 2018)</em>

<h3>Q: When completing the Security Assessment Report (SAR), is it appropriate to assign the same values to tables F-1 and F-2 for the initial assessment? What about assigning the same values to ES-1, F-1, and F-2 for the annual assessment if there were POA&Ms at the start of the annual assessment?</h3>

<p><strong>A:</strong> While For the initial assessment, it is appropriate to assign the same values to tables F-1 and F-2. For the annual assessment, SAR tables ES-1, F-1, and F-2 should have the same values as well. All three tables account for all system risks. Because FedRAMP guidance requires that the 3PAO assess all POA&Ms for the annual assessment, the POA&M risks are also included in those tables for the annual assessment. In summary, the tables account for all system risks reported in:
</p>
<p>
  *POA&Ms (if any exist at the start of the annual assessment)
  *Vulnerability scans
  *NIST 800-53 controls assessment
  *Penetration testing
  *Other assessment activities performed for either the initial or annual assessment <em>(March 21, 2018)</em>

<h3>Q: If a CSP wants to complete a FedRAMP Readiness Review, but is then going to pursue an Agency-sponsored FedRAMP authorization, can the CSP use the same 3PAO for both assessments?
</h3>

<p><strong>A:</strong> A CSP can use the same 3PAO for completing their Readiness Assessment Report (RAR) and their full security assessment when working with an Agency or the JAB. The same 3PAO, however, cannot consult between assessments – this is outlined in the ISO 17020 requirements and FedRAMP-A2LA 3PAO accreditation requirements.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, to help ensure successful completion of the RAR, the FedRAMP PMO has created a <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/resources/documents/3PAO_Readiness_Assessment_Report_Guide.pdf">FedRAMP RAR Guide for 3PAOs</a> that includes useful tips and lessons learned. <em>(February 21, 2018)</em>

<h3>Q: Do the FedRAMP security controls restrict data to reside only within the United States?</h3>

<p><strong>A:</strong> There are no FedRAMP requirements restricting data to within the United States. There are multiple security controls that detail where data is stored, what the boundary of the system is, and where and how data in transit is protected. We have some providers that are authorized through FedRAMP that are located globally, although a majority of service providers do restrict their data to the United States. It is up to each individual Agency and Authorizing Official to place restrictions, if needed, on data location. <em>(February 14, 2018) </em>

<h3>Q: Does the “FedRAMP Ready” designation allow CSPs to bid on contracts if their systems don’t have an existing Authority to Operate (ATO)? If not, how will a CSP that does not have a current ATO respond to an RFP? Will the CSP be required to obtain a Joint Authorization Board (JAB) Provisional Authority to Operate (P-ATO)?</h3>

<p><strong>A:</strong> CSPs whose systems do not have existing ATOs are allowed to bid on contracts. Agencies can request a CSP to have a timeline for obtaining an ATO, but should not limit the request to CSPs with ATOs. Please contact the FedRAMP PMO if an Agency is making that request.
</p>
<p>
The “FedRAMP Ready” designation is a market indicator to Agencies that a system has a high likelihood of obtaining a JAB P-ATO or an Agency ATO. Agencies can be confident that systems that meet the FedRAMP Ready requirements actually have the key capabilities needed to fit their security needs. Therefore, a small cloud service provider will have the ability to attain FedRAMP Ready and be available for Agency review in the FedRAMP Marketplace. The Agency can then decide to issue an ATO based on the understanding that the system meets the Readiness Assessment requirements. <em>(February 14, 2018)</em>

<h3>Q: How do security controls impact Quality of Service (QoS) of an application or system?</h3>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Quality of Service (QoS) and security are interrelated. The implementation of security controls must be thoughtfully considered and deployed/implemented so as NOT to adversely impact an application's or system’s QoS. A good security program addresses confidentiality, integrity, AND availability. QoS is an important component of a well thought out security posture. <em>(February 7, 2018)</em>

<h3>Q: I’d like to know the criteria that the FedRAMP PMO uses to review Agency authorization packages. Where can I find that information?</h3>

<p><strong>A:</strong> The FedRAMP PMO reviews Agency authorization packages after an Agency has conducted its own in-depth review of the CSP’s authorization package; has issued an ATO for the service; and the final, complete authorization package has been uploaded to the FedRAMP secure repository.
</p>
<p>
The FedRAMP Agency Package Review Team focuses their review on key technical security concerns/critical controls and completeness of the authorization package. Results of the Team’s review are captured in the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/resources/templates/Agency-ATO-Report-Template-Version.pdf">FedRAMP Agency ATO Review Template</a> (available on fedramp.gov). The completed Agency Review Template (report) is made available to the specific CSP, the initial authorizing Agency, and any other Agency interested in using that particular cloud service.
</p>
<p>
However, Agencies and CSPs are cautioned not to overly focus on the Review Template checks, as FedRAMP PMO reviewers also spot­ check other areas within the package as part of the FedRAMP authorization determination. <em>(February 7, 2018)</em>
