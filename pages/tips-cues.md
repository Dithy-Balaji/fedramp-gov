Many of our Cloud Service Providers (CSPs), Federal Agencies, and Third Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs) share common issues and questions when going through the FedRAMP process. To help guide our stakeholders, we provide weekly tips and address frequently asked questions and concerns. Below you will find our most recent month of Tips & Cues. To receive our weekly email, sign up [here](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USGSA/subscriber/new?qsp=USGSA_2224) for our listserv.

<h2>March 2018 Tips & Cues</h2>
<div class="q1">
<h3>TIP: Avoid adding time to your authorization process by successfully completing the System Security Plan (SSP) review the first time! Here are some tips from the FedRAMP PMO on how to create a strong SSP.</h3>
<p>
1. Submit a complete and well structured SSP.
</p>
<p>
2. Dedicate enough resources – often one writer is not enough to complete the SSP, and you may have to allot additional resources and subject matter experts to complete.
 </p>
<p>
3. Employ the four C’s of writing: Clear – straightforward, avoiding convoluted or overly long phrases; Concise – pack the most meaning into your words; Concrete – concrete writing is precise and detail oriented; and Correct – correct grammar, mechanics, and format are baseline expectations for writing.
 </p>
<p>
4. Ensure the writer(s) has knowledge of the system and/or can obtain the information from others and be able to communicate it.
 </p>
<p>
5. Perform a quality review on the SSP.
 </p>
<p>
Doing these things cannot guarantee a successful SSP review, but will greatly enhance your chances. <em>(March 28, 2018) </em>

<h3>Q: What is a security architecture diagram and what should it include?</h3>

<p><strong>A:</strong> A security architecture diagram is a component of the System Security Plan (SSP) that illustrates how technical security controls are implemented in the environment. It also articulates the overall security program strategy in alignment with the position and selection of security control implementations. A security architecture diagram MUST be a stand-alone document and address the requirements outlined in the control supplemental guidance in PL-8. It is not sufficient to reference other sections of the SSP or outside product guides.
 </p>
<p>
Architectural and network diagrams must include all possible communication links between the CSP and Federal Agencies, as well as paths into the system boundary. If customers are not yet connecting directly, a CSP can identify all planned connection points in the SSP. The diagrams should be completed prior to writing implementation statements. <em>(March 28, 2018)</em>

<h3>Q: When completing the Security Assessment Report (SAR), is it appropriate to assign the same values to tables F-1 and F-2 for the initial assessment? What about assigning the same values to ES-1, F-1, and F-2 for the annual assessment if there were POA&Ms at the start of the annual assessment?</h3>

<p><strong>A:</strong> While For the initial assessment, it is appropriate to assign the same values to tables F-1 and F-2. For the annual assessment, SAR tables ES-1, F-1, and F-2 should have the same values as well. All three tables account for all system risks. Because FedRAMP guidance requires that the 3PAO assess all POA&Ms for the annual assessment, the POA&M risks are also included in those tables for the annual assessment. In summary, the tables account for all system risks reported in:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
<p>
 
The POA&Ms (if any exist at the start of the annual assessment) 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>

Vulnerbility scans 
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>

NIST 800-53 controls assessment.

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>

Penetration testing

<h3>Q: Is the CSP responsible for ensuring the quality of the work performed by the Third Party Assessment Organization (3PAO)?
</h3>

<p><strong>A:</strong> While accredited 3PAOs perform security assessments of FedRAMP cloud services, the CSP is responsible for all 3PAO activities and deliverables related to the assessment of their cloud offering. The CSP manages and oversees these activities accordingly.
</p>
<p>
Exceptions are delivery of the Security Assessment Plan (SAP), Security Assessment Report (SAR), and the SAR results. In order to maintain the integrity and independence of these documents, they must be provided to the PMO directly from the 3PAO. While the 3PAO makes the final determination on the security results in the SAR, the CSP should ensure the quality of the SAR and all 3PAO deliverables provided to FedRAMP. <em>(March 21, 2018)</em>

<h3>Q: Are there any alternative formats available to help facilitate reviews? Sometimes scan files are in a format that does not allow reviewers to do their analysis with common tools.</h3>

<p><strong>A:</strong> For the Security Assessment Report (SAR), always provide scan file outputs in a “machine-readable” format that permits analysis using common tools. For example, XML files can be formatted into something that is Microsoft Excel compatible in the following way (Applies to: Excel 2016, Excel 2013):
 </p>
<p>
1. On the Data tab, click From Other Sources > From XML Import.
  </p>
<p>
2. Browse to your XML file, and click Open.
  </p>
<p>
3. If the XML file doesn’t refer to a schema, Excel offers to create a schema for you.
  </p>
<p>
4. Click OK.
  </p>
<p>
5. Choose where you want to import the data.
 </p>
<p>
Additionally, files can be provided in a “.CSV” format that opens directly into Excel. <em>(March 14, 2018) </em>

<h3>Q: Can the Security Assessment Plan (SAP) and/or the Security Assessment Report (SAR) templates be modified?</h3>

<p><strong>A:</strong> The SAP and/or the SAR template can be modified to add content, but content cannot be removed from the template. So you will be able to add information to help bolster security packages, but you cannot eliminate parts or portions of the templates. <em>(March 14, 2018)</em>

<h3>Q: I received a request from a Federal Agency to review my system’s Provisional Authorization to Operate (P-ATO) letter, and I am concerned that sharing the letter will violate sensitivity policies. Is it appropriate to share an authorization letter with Agencies??</h3>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes! The Authorization Letter is intended to serve as evidence that the CSP has obtained their FedRAMP P-ATO. The CSP may show or even provide a copy to a requesting Agency. Indeed, the Agency may need a copy for their own ATO package as evidence they selected a CSP with a valid FedRAMP P-ATO. <em>(March 7, 2018)</em>

<h3>Q: Could you explain the purpose and process behind requiring a CSP to complete an incident response test and contingency plan test before their 3PAO assessment?</h3>

<p><strong>A:</strong> If a CSP does not complete an incident response test and contingency plan test before the 3PAO assessment, the Joint Authorization Board (JAB) will not issue the cloud offering a Provisional Authorization to Operate (P-ATO). These tests must be conducted in accordance with NIST SP 800-53, and the results should be made available to the 3PAO for evaluation. Once a P-ATO is granted, the tests should continue to be completed prior to the annual assessment so that the 3PAO can evaluate the results as part of that assessment. <em>(March 7, 2018)</em>
