Executive Summary

This document describes a general Security Assessment Framework (SAF) for the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP). FedRAMP is a Government-wide program that provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud-based services. FedRAMP uses a &quot;do once, use many times&quot; framework that intends to save costs, time, and staff required to conduct redundant Agency security assessments and process monitoring reports.

FedRAMP was developed in collaboration with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the General Services Administration (GSA), the Department of Defense (DOD), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Many other Government
Agencies and working groups participated in reviewing and standardizing the controls,
policies and procedures.
