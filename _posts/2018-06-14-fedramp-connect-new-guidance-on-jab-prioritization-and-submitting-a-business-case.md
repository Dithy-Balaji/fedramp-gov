FedRAMP is excited to announce that we are starting our next round of FedRAMP Connect! 

**Business Cases for this round of FedRAMP Connect will be due July 13th by 5:00pm eastern and should be submitted to info@fedramp.gov.** 

As part of the first step in <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/jab-authorization/">"pursuing a Provisional Authority to Operate (P-ATO) from the Joint Authorization Board (JAB)"</a>, CSPs are required to participate in our prioritization process called FedRAMP Connect. In order to reduce the time between CSPs being prioritized and kicking-off with the JAB, the FedRAMP PMO has decided to aim to prioritize three CSPs each quarter. As part of the prioritization decision, CSPs are required to become FedRAMP Ready within 60-days of being prioritized and must now be able to kick-off with the JAB within 90-days. Going forward, the FedRAMP PMO will collect Business Cases on a rolling basis and will have cut off dates for each quarter's prioritization decision.

In order to gather the required information for FedRAMP Connect, CSPs interested in working with the JAB will need to submit a Business Case to info@fedrmap.gov comprised of a simple PDF form and excel worksheet gathering demand information. This Business Case submission provides a normalized view for comparison of CSOs and allows prioritization to be conducted in a consistent and fair manner. FedRAMP has updated our guidance on JAB Prioritization and Business Case submission [ADD LINK]. This document includes information on: 
* The JAB prioritization criteria 
* How to submit a Business Case 
* What qualifies as current, indirect, and potential demand 
* The Business Case evaluation methodology 

We recommend that any CSP interested in being prioritized to work with the JAB read this document in its entirety and review the required Business Case attachments. 

**Business Cases for this round of FedRAMP Connect will be due July 13th by 5:00pm eastern and should be submitted to info@fedramp.gov.**

We take these business cases incredibly seriously, and weâ€™ve worked to streamline The PMO will hold a webinar in the coming weeks to review the guidance and answer questions from CSPs. Additionally, after the webinar, the PMO will be available to have one-on-one coaching calls with CSPs to provide them with advice on their Business Case or help them qualify their demand. 

Look out for an invite to the FedRAMP Connect Webinar next week and we look forward to working with each of you during the FedRAMP Connect process!
