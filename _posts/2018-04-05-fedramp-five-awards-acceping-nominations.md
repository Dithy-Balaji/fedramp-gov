FedRAMP turns six this year! As a way to celebrate, we’re introducing awards to recognize government partners who have helped FedRAMP grow, develop, and improve over time. The first ever awards - which we’re calling the “FedRAMP Five” - will give recognition to some of the Agency partners to whom we owe our success.

The FedRAMP Five Awards will be given in the following categories:
<table>

    <th>Description of Award</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Large Agency</td>
    <td>The Large Agency Award recognizes the CFO Act Agency <a href="https://cfo.gov/about/">CFO Act Agency</a> that demonstrates exceptional leadership through excellent responsiveness and communication, thought leadership, and a willingness to partner with the FedRAMP PMO to help improve the FedRAMP program.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
