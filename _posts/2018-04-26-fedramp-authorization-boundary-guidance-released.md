Over the previous year, the FedRAMP PMO has recognized that cloud service providers (CSPs) have difficulty scoping the authorization boundary of their cloud service offerings (CSOs). Framing a system from a FISMA perspective is challenging for CSPs, especially as the leverage of external services to augment systems and general complexity of cloud services continues to increase. As a core component of any FedRAMP System Security Plan, it is imperative that CSPs understand how to accurately describe and illustrate their system authorization boundary.

In partnership with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the JAB, and trusted industry partners, the FedRAMP PMO has released guidance describing key considerations CSPs should make when defining their authorization boundaries. In releasing guidance, the PMO hopes to inform CSP’s conceptualization and design of their boundaries. Additionally, we hope it informs the review and approval of those systems by Agencies and independent assessors. Importantly, we expect this guidance to continue as a living document, to be updated and expanded in accordance with the evolution of cloud services. 

Relevant security package documentation and templates, including the Readiness Assessment Report (RAR), System Security Plan (SSP), System Assessment Plan (SAP), and System Assessment Report (SAR) have also been updated in alignment with the PMO’s provided boundary guidance. 

While the PMO hopes this guidance provides immediate utility to all FedRAMP stakeholders, we continue to encourage engaging the PMO early and often when generating SSP documentation, especially with regards to boundaries.
