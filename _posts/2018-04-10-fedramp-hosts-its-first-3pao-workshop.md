The FedRAMP PMO is pleased to release the first volume of the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/resources/documents/CSP_Authorization_Playbook_Getting_Started_with_FedRAMP.pdf">Cloud Service Provider (CSP) Authorization Playbook: Getting Started with FedRAMP</a>!

Many CSPs are interested in pursuing a FedRAMP authorization for their cloud offering(s), but often have questions on the process and how to get started. The CSP Authorization Playbook is designed to be a comprehensive guide for CSPs interested or pursuing the FedRAMP process. The playbook will address the end-to-end FedRAMP authorization process, covering everything from developing authorization strategies, the process for gaining authorization from the JAB or Agencies, and the importance of continuous monitoring activity. 

**<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/resources/documents/CSP_Authorization_Playbook_Getting_Started_with_FedRAMP.pdf">Volume I: Getting Started with FedRAMP</a>** focuses on understanding the FedRAMP process at a high level and how to initiate an authorization effort. We provide an overview of all of the partners involved in a FedRAMP authorization, things to consider when determining your authorization strategy, the types of authorizations, and important considerations for your offering when working with FedRAMP.

The CSP Authorization Playbook will ultimately be three volumes and resemble the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/resources/documents/Agency_Authorization_Playbook.pdf">Agency Authorization Playbook</a> - providing a guide for CSPs that covers the entire FedRAMP authorization lifecycle and shares best practices to achieve a successful authorization. The second volume of the CSP Authorization Playbook will cover the authorization process and the third volume will detail post authorization activities, such as continuous monitoring and Agencies leveraging a CSP authorization. 

Look out for the second and third volumes of the CSP Authorization Playbook, which will be released this year! If you have any questions about the playbook or how to get started with  FedRAMP, please reach out to us at info@fedramp.gov.


On Friday, March 30th, the FedRAMP PMO held a workshop with our accredited 3PAO vendors. The workshop consisted of a morning plenary session, which shared reasons for the updating the 3PAO requirements, insight into new FedRAMP policy updates, and an overview of common pitfalls of current assessments and how to avoid them. Following the morning briefing, the FedRAMP PMO met with 3PAOs one-on-one to receive any feedback on the updated requirements and a chance to review any other issues 3PAOs are facing. 

In all, 65 attendees from 32 3PAOs joined the 3PAO Workshop. The goal is to continue to provide these workshops for 3PAOs to connect with each other, share lessons learned in security and implementation, and build relationships. 

Here are some of the key takeaways from the workshop:

**Why We’re Updating**
The FedRAMP PMO is working with our partner A2LA to update 3PAO accreditation requirements to ensure a more consistent assessment experience program-wide.

**What We’re Updating** 
Overall, the new updates require 3PAOs to:
1. Participate in mandatory trainings
2. Ensure 3PAO contract employees are held to the same standard as employees of their firm
3. Strengthen the quality management system

Additionally, additions to the 3PAO requirements include expanding the scope of accreditation to not just organizations, but also to include a hands-on assessment exercises for individual assessors and teams. 

**Tips and Tricks** 
The FedRAMP PMO also shared “Tips and Tricks” on how to best maintain accreditation, including (but not limited to):
* 3PAOs should be sure to validate all CSP information during assessments and check with the FedRAMP PMO about any areas of uncertainty. This also applies for any risk determinations and risk deviations.
* Above all, 3PAOs should be extremely familiar with the systems that they are assessing and how government data is flowing through it.
* 3PAOs should stay current on the latest policies. Updates to several FedRAMP documents were released on March 20, 2018, including: 
        1. FedRAMP Vulnerability Scanning Requirements V1.0
        2. Guide for Determining Eligibility and Requirements for the Use of Sampling for Vulnerability Scans V1.0
        3. Draft Automated Vulnerability Risk Adjustment Framework V0.1

**Next Steps**
Following the 3PAO Workshop, all 3PAOs received the updated requirements as well as the workshop slides via email. **3PAOs have until COB Friday, April 13th to review the proposed updates to the requirements and provide comments and any feedback to the PMO.
FedRAMP plans to officially release the updated requirements in mid-May.**

**Tiger Teams** 
Finally, as part of the requirements updates, the PMO will begin convening tiger teams to help strengthen 3PAO performance and address issues 3PAOs face in their assessments (contracting, new guidance documents, templates, training needs). If you are interested in participating in a tiger team, please let us know by emailing info@fedramp.gov!

Thank you to everyone who attended the 3PAO Workshop! We look forward to the next one. If you have any questions regarding the workshop or new requirements, please contact us at info@fedramp.gov.
