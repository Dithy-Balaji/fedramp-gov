We’re excited to announce that we’ve made some upgrades to our FedRAMP website! We know that FedRAMP.gov has a lot of information and we want you to be able to find what you need as quickly as possible. In response to feedback from our stakeholders, we’ve added two new features to our website that should help you find the resources and information you’re looking for faster.   

**Table Sort Feature:** We’ve added a sort feature to the tables on our <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/documents/">Documents</a> and <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/templates/">Templates</a> pages. This means that you can sort these resource tables by alphabetical order for Document/Template Category, Title, Description, and Type. You can also sort them by date in the Last Updated column. We added this feature in response to feedback from our stakeholders about wanting to see which documents or templates have been updated most recently. To meet this need, we will also continue to publish blogs and send notifications to our listserv every time new resources are released or existing documents/templates are updated. 

**Search Feature:** We’ve updated the search function to our website and wanted to share with you some of its capabilities. In the top right corner you will find the search bar where you can enter any term and it will bring up relevant web pages, blogs, and documents. For example, a search of “Tailored” yields a pletera of results including all blogs that mention FedRAMP Tailored, templates that pertain to the Tailored baseline, and our FedRAMP Tailored specific site. 

If you have any questions or feedback about these added features, please reach out to info@fedramp.gov. We always appreciate your feedback. 

Hope you enjoy this added ease while navigating the FedRAMP website!
