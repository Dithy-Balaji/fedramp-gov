### Reader Submission: Case for using FedRAMP

Early in my federal security experience, I supported a government application hosting data center enclave as a security configuration manager for a large internet-facing government system. This required understanding many FISMA, NIST, and DISA controls and security configurations. I also had to verify that the systems in the data center were operating properly to these control requirements, which meant sending continuous monitoring reports to federal agencies.

### New 3PAOs

The PMO has added two new Third Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs) to its roster of accredited independent assessors.

[MBL Technologies](http://www.mbltechnologies.com/) and [RSM US LLP](http://rsmus.com/) are available for use by agencies and Cloud Services Providers (CSPs). The American Association for Laboratory Accreditation (A2LA) accredits FedRAMP 3PAOs with the FedRAMP PMO providing final approval. Please contact [A2LA](https://www.a2la.org/) for more information on becoming an accredited FedRAMP 3PAO.
