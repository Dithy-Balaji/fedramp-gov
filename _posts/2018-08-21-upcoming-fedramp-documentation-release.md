The FedRAMP PMO is excited to announce that we have updated ten documents and added one new document to improve continuous monitoring processes, clarify language in the Readiness Assessment Report (RAR) templates, and incorporate new requirements and guidance in the SSP templates/baselines. 

We will be releasing these updated and new documents next week and they will be made available on our <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/templates/">Templates</a> and <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov/documents/">Documents</a> pages. These updates are part of a new quarterly documents release cadence the PMO has put in place to ensure our stakeholders know in advance when changes to documents and templates will occur and when updates will be released. 

Below is a list of documents we’ve updated or added and a brief description of the revisions and upgrades we’ve made to them. We will update this blog with the links to the documents and send out a reminder email when they are available.

**_Updated Templates:_**

**System Security Plans (Low, Moderate, and High Baseline) and LI-SaaS Appendix B:** We updated these four System Security Plan templates to align with the updated NIST SP 800-63 and Digital Identity (formerly E-Authentication) requirements. Additionally, we added remediation requirements for Low vulnerabilities and made minor updates to enhance control guidance and functional issues. 

**High and Moderate Readiness Assessment Reports (RARs):** We clarified the language throughout the RAR templates and included expectations around the use of external services. 

**New Cloud Service Offering (CSO) or Feature Onboarding Request:** We conducted a thorough update of almost the entire document to clarify the approval process for the FedRAMP New Cloud Service Offering (CSO) or Feature Onboarding process. This template should be used in conjunction with the new Significant Change Policies and Procedures.

**Significant Change Request Form:** We updated this template to correct minor grammatical and functional issues. Additionally, we now require a 3PAO’s signature on the form to verify they have reviewed and approved the control list. This form should be used in conjunction with the new Significant Change Policies and Procedures document.

**Vulnerability Deviation Request Form:** We converted this template from a PDF to an Excel spreadsheet to allow for easier automation. 

**_Updated Document:_**

**Baseline of Controls:** We combined the FedRAMP Low, Moderate, High, and LI-SaaS baselines into a single Excel template to make it easier to navigate and compare the different control requirements. 

**_New Document:_**

**Significant Change Policies and Procedures:** This is a new document that we developed to walk our stakeholders through the significant change process by 1.) describing the significant change process, 2.) delineating the appropriate forms to use, and 3.) providing baseline control sets to be tested by 3PAOs for specific significant changes.

**Additionally, we've updated our implementation policies for the below templates.**

**_Implementation Policy Updates:_** 

System Security Plans (Low, Moderate, and High Baseline) and LI-SaaS Appendix B: Upon request, FedRAMP can provide redlined versions of the documents to assist CSPs with the changes. Rather than swapping all content to the new template, CSPs may alternatively incorporate the changes into their version of the SSP. These changes must be incorporated before the CSP's next annual assessment (for annual assessments after Oct 31, 2018).

High and Moderate Readiness Assessment Reports (RARs): To facilitate the PMO's review of the RAR, 3PAOs are strongly encouraged to transition to the new template now, even for assessments that are in progress. Beginning September 30, 2018, all RARs must be developed using the new templates.

New Cloud Service Offering (CSO) or Feature Onboarding Request: This template should be used immediately for any CSO that is interested in using the New Cloud Service Offering (CSO) or Feature Onboarding process. The new Significant Change Request Policies and Procedures document should be reviewed before use of this document.

Significant Change Request Form: This document is free to use now, but must be used for newly submitted significant change requests on or after September 30, 2018.

Vulnerability Deviation Request Form: CSPs are free to use the old (PDF) version of the Vulnerability Deviation Request Form, however, due to ease of completion and automation, FedRAMP strongly suggests mitigating to this new Excel version of the form.

We hope you find these template and document updates useful! If you have any questions or feedback, please reach out to info@fedramp.gov.
