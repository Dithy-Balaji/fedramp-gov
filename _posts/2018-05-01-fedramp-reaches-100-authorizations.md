We could not be more excited to announce that we just reached a huge milestone - 100 Cloud Service Provider (CSP) Authorizations! 

This incredible accomplishment can be attributed to the hard work on the sides of both the FedRAMP PMO team and our industry and Agency partners. This is certainly something to be proud of and calls for a celebration! 

In light of reaching 100 CSPs, we wanted to share a little color on the types of services authorized over the years.

In the 5 years since FedRAMP’s inception in 2012, we have authorized:
* 14 IaaS solutions
* 8 IaaS/PaaS solutions
* 2 IaaS / SaaS solutions
* 1 IaaS / PaaS / SaaS solutions
* 9 PaaS solutions
* 7 PaaS / SaaS solutions, and
* 59 SaaS solutions

Furthermore, nearly ⅔ of our authorizations have been sponsored by our Agency partners - at a total of 68. The remaining 32 were authorized by the Joint Authorization Board (JAB) as Provisional-ATOs, to be leveraged across government. 

**What does this mean for the American public?** 

Well - it means that we’ve avoided nearly $243 million, simply from the reuse of FedRAMP ATO’s. That is $243 million in costs avoided and time saved for Federal Agencies and employees alike, and $243 million that went to servicing the various federal missions to the American taxpayer. It also means that we’ve ensured that 100 Cloud Services are securely protecting Federal information. 

It also means that our vendors have over 5 million assets available for Federal agencies to use - and that covers also ⅓ of the world’s internet traffic -- making the US Government’s use of cloud more secure - but also private citizens and the commercial sector as well.

And guess what? We’re just getting started! We’ve enabled almost 50 reuses in 2018 alone. At this rapid pace we, know this is just the beginning of our story!

**Looking to the Next 100 Authorizations** 

In our first 100 authorizations, we established a core market of secure Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solutions. As the <a href="https://marketplace.fedramp.gov">FedRAMP Marketplace</a> has matured, our partners have leveraged  solutions and promoted the adoption and authorization of Software-as-as-Service (SaaS) solutions. Looking the next 100 authorizations, we are committed to growing the market for secure SaaS solutions, starting with  the launch of our FedRAMP Tailored baseline - our new approach to authorizing low-impact SaaS.

**Thank You!** 

We are so excited to share this with you. We would like to thank our many partners in government and in industry for being a part of journey here.

We look forward to the next 100 authorizations, and further successes.
